- **Is this aligned with the "minimal, proactive" philosophy?**

### üß† ADHD-Specific Improvements
We especially welcome contributions from people with ADHD who understand:
- **Executive function challenges**
- **Task initiation difficulties**
- **Attention and focus patterns**
- **Overwhelm and decision paralysis**

### üìù Areas for Contribution

#### Core Features
- **Better reminder messages** - More effective, gentle nudges
- **Improved AI prompting** - Better task breakdown for ADHD minds
- **Context preservation** - Remember where you left off
- **Integration improvements** - Better Obsidian workflow integration

#### Code Quality

## Pull Request Guidelines

1. **Keep it focused** - One feature or fix per PR
2. **Test thoroughly** - Make sure it works in real Obsidian usage
3. **Follow existing patterns** - Match the current code style
4. **Update documentation** - If you change behavior, update README
5. **Consider ADHD impact** - Will this help or hurt people with executive function challenges?

### Good PR Examples
- "Fix reminder notifications not showing on macOS"
- "Add 'take a break' reminder after 90 minutes of work"
- "Improve AI prompt for literature review tasks"

### Avoid These
- "Add 15 new configuration options"
- "Completely rewrite the UI with complex dashboard"
- "Add social sharing and gamification features"

## Code Style

- **Simple and readable** - ADHD developers will be reading this too
- **Minimal abstractions** - Avoid complex inheritance or patterns
- **Clear naming** - Functions and variables should be obvious
- **Helpful comments** - Explain the "why", not just the "what"

```typescript
// Good: Clear, specific, explains why
async function showGentleReminder() {
  // Only show reminder if enough time has passed to avoid spam
  if (now - this.lastReminderTime < 10 * 60 * 1000) {
    return;
  }
  // ... rest of function
}

// Avoid: Generic, unclear purpose
async function processReminder() {
  // ... complex logic with no explanation
}
```

## Testing

Manual testing checklist:
- [ ] Plugin loads without errors
- [ ] Settings can be configured
- [ ] Reminders appear at correct intervals
- [ ] AI planning works with valid API key
- [ ] Plugin can be disabled/enabled
- [ ] No conflicts with other plugins

## Questions?

- **Open a discussion** for general questions
- **Open an issue** for bugs or specific feature requests
- **Check existing issues** before creating new ones

## Code of Conduct

- **Be patient and kind** - Many contributors have ADHD and may need extra processing time
- **Assume good intentions** - We're all trying to help each other succeed
- **Focus on solutions** - Instead of just identifying problems, suggest improvements
- **Share your experience** - Your ADHD perspective is valuable, even if you're not a developer
