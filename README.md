# Create symbolic link to your vault
ln -s "$(pwd)" "/path/to/your/vault/.obsidian/plugins/proactive-phd"
```

2. **Hot Reload During Development**
```bash
# Watch for changes and rebuild
npm run dev
```

#### Method 3: BRAT Plugin (Beta Reviewers Auto-update Tool)

1. Install the BRAT plugin from Obsidian's community plugins
2. Add this repository URL: `https://github.com/alexbnewhouse/proactivity`
3. BRAT will automatically install and update the plugin

### Plugin Configuration

After installing the plugin, configure it for optimal ADHD support:

1. **API Configuration**
   - Add your OpenAI API key (same as backend)
   - Set backend server URL: `http://localhost:3001`

2. **ADHD Support Settings**
   - ‚úÖ Enable Proactive Notifications
   - ‚úÖ Enable Pattern Detection
   - ‚úÖ Enable Hyperfocus Protection
   - Set max daily notifications: 8-12 (adjust based on preference)

3. **Obsidian Integration**
   - Set your dissertation folder path (e.g., "Dissertation")
   - Configure daily notes path
   - Enable smart linking and progress tracking

4. **Personalization**
   - Adjust notification timing for your schedule
   - Set your preferred task breakdown depth
   - Configure energy check intervals

## Usage Guide

### Basic Workflow

1. **Set Your Energy Level**: Use the energy buttons or command palette to indicate your current focus capacity
2. **Get Task Suggestions**: The AI will suggest ADHD-friendly tasks based on your energy and context
3. **Break Down Overwhelming Tasks**: Use "Break down current task" command for complex projects
4. **Track Progress**: The plugin automatically tracks your work patterns and celebrates wins

### Out of Office Mode üèñÔ∏è

ProActive PhD includes a sophisticated "out of office" system to pause proactive features when you need a break:

#### Quick Modes
- **Vacation Mode**: `Ctrl/Cmd + P` ‚Üí "Start vacation mode"
  - Pauses all notifications and task suggestions
  - Emergency override available with keyword
  - Auto-resume after specified days

- **Deep Focus Mode**: `Ctrl/Cmd + P` ‚Üí "Start deep focus mode"
  - Pauses only interrupting notifications
  - Keeps helpful features active
  - Perfect for hyperfocus sessions

- **Sick Day Mode**: Available via API or status bar
  - Gentle pause for health recovery
  - Minimal interruptions

#### Custom Out of Office
Configure your own break modes with:
```javascript
// API call to backend
POST /api/out-of-office/start
{
  "reason": "personal",
  "duration": 48,
  "durationType": "hours",
  "message": "Taking time for family üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶",
  "pauseServices": ["notifications", "patterns"],
  "enableEmergencyMode": true,
  "emergencyKeyword": "URGENT"
}
```

#### Emergency Override
When out of office mode is active with emergency mode enabled:
- Include your emergency keyword (default: "URGENT") in any request
- System temporarily allows the action while maintaining overall break mode
- Perfect for true emergencies without fully disrupting your rest

### Commands Available

| Command | Description | Shortcut |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| Break down current task | AI-powered task breakdown | - |
| Quick energy level check | Assess and update energy | - |
| Start focused work session | 25-minute Pomodoro timer | - |

### ADHD-Specific Features

#### Pattern Recognition
The system learns your patterns and provides personalized interventions:
- **Procrastination Detection**: Notices when you're avoiding tasks and offers gentle help
- **Hyperfocus Protection**: Reminds you to take breaks during intense focus sessions
- **Time Blindness Support**: Provides time anchors and realistic estimates
- **Overwhelm Prevention**: Breaks down cognitive load when you're struggling

#### Task Adaptation
Every task suggestion is optimized for ADHD:
- **Granular Steps**: 5-25 minute micro-tasks to reduce initiation friction
