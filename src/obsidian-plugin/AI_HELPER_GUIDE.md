## Quick Start Guide

The Proactivity plugin now includes a powerful AI-powered task breakdown assistant designed specifically for ADHD users. Here's how to use it:

### 🚀 How to Access the AI Helper

**Method 1: Command Palette**
1. Press `Ctrl+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+P` (Mac) to open command palette
2. Type "AI Task Breakdown" 
3. Select "🤖 AI Task Breakdown Assistant"

**Method 3: Ribbon Icon**
- Look for the 🤖 robot icon in the left ribbon
- Click it to open the AI helper

### 💡 How to Use

1. **Describe your task**: Tell the AI about something you're struggling with
   - Example: "Write the methodology section for my climate change research"
   - Example: "Organize my literature review notes"
   - Example: "Plan my dissertation chapter on data analysis"

2. **Set your context** (optional but helpful):
   - **Available time**: How much time you have (15min to 4+ hours)
   - **Energy level**: Your current energy (😴 Depleted to ⚡ High)  
   - **Preferred complexity**: How detailed you want the breakdown
   - **Executive function challenges**: Check boxes for areas you struggle with

3. **Get ADHD-friendly breakdown**: The AI will create:
   - Small, concrete steps (5-30 minutes each)
   - Clear instructions with no ambiguity
   - Motivational boosters
   - Time estimates for each step
   - Tips for overcoming common obstacles

4. **Add to your vault**: Click to add individual steps or all steps to your daily note

### 🧠 ADHD-Specific Features

- **Micro-tasks**: Breaks overwhelming projects into tiny, manageable pieces
- **Executive function awareness**: Accounts for working memory, task initiation, planning challenges
- **Energy-matched tasks**: Suggests appropriate tasks based on your current energy
- **Procrastination-busting**: Provides specific first steps to overcome task paralysis
- **Motivational support**: Each task includes encouraging context and tips

### ⚙️ Configuration

Go to Settings > Proactivity to configure:
- API key for enhanced AI features
- Server URL (defaults to localhost:3001)
- ADHD support preferences
- Sync settings with browser extension

### 🔄 Sync with Browser Extension

The AI helper works seamlessly with the browser extension:
- Tasks created here sync to your browser dashboard
- Energy levels are shared between both tools
- Completed tasks update across all platforms

### 🎯 Example Workflows

**Research Paper Writing:**
Input: "Write introduction for my paper on climate change impacts"
→ Gets broken down into: research background sources → create outline → write hook sentence → draft main argument → add citations → revise for flow

**Data Analysis:**
Input: "Analyze survey responses from my dissertation study" 
→ Gets broken down into: clean data → descriptive stats → code themes → run statistical tests → create visualizations → interpret results

**Literature Review:**
Input: "Organize 50 research papers for my literature review"
→ Gets broken down into: create citation manager → sort by themes → read abstracts → make summary notes → identify gaps → write synthesis

### 💪 Pro Tips

1. **Be specific**: "Write methodology section" is better than "work on dissertation"
2. **Use context**: The more you tell the AI about your situation, the better the breakdown
3. **Start small**: If overwhelmed, ask for "next 30 minutes" of work only
4. **Update energy levels**: Your energy affects the suggestions you get
5. **Use with Pomodoro**: Each step is designed to fit focus sessions

### 🐛 Troubleshooting

**AI not working?**
- Check if the backend server is running (`npm start` in the backend folder)
- Verify your API key in settings
- The system has fallback mode if AI is unavailable

**Tasks not syncing?**
- Ensure browser extension sync is enabled in settings
- Check that both tools are pointing to the same backend URL

**Need help?**
- All features work offline with intelligent fallbacks
- Check the console for error messages
- Restart Obsidian if the plugin seems stuck
