## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Plugin Not Loading
1. Check Obsidian version (minimum 0.15.0)
2. Ensure Safe Mode is disabled
3. Verify plugin files in correct directory
4. Restart Obsidian

#### API Connection Issues
1. Confirm backend server is running (`http://localhost:3001/health`)
2. Check firewall settings
3. Verify API key in settings
4. Test with simple task breakdown

#### Notifications Not Working
1. Check notification permissions in Obsidian
2. Verify max daily notifications setting
3. Ensure not in out-of-office mode
4. Check quiet hours configuration

#### Pattern Detection Not Accurate
1. Allow 3-5 days for initial pattern learning
2. Ensure consistent energy level updates
3. Check behavior data in console
4. Adjust detection sensitivity

### Debug Mode

Enable debug mode in settings for detailed logging:

```javascript
// Console commands for debugging
ProActivePHD.getStatus()
ProActivePHD.getPatterns()
ProActivePHD.testConnection()
ProActivePHD.exportData()
```

### Performance Optimization

For large vaults or slower devices:

1. **Reduce Update Frequency**
   - Increase energy check intervals
   - Lower pattern detection sensitivity
   - Disable real-time progress tracking

2. **Limit Features**
   - Disable smart linking for large vaults
   - Use manual energy updates only
   - Reduce notification frequency

3. **Data Management**
   - Regular cleanup of old daily notes
   - Archive completed task data
   - Optimize vault structure

## Development

### Plugin Architecture

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.ts                 # Main plugin class
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ proactive-view.ts       # Main UI panel
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ obsidian-integration-service.ts  # Obsidian API integration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ task-breakdown-modal.ts # Task breakdown interface
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ adhd-pattern-detector.ts # Local pattern detection
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ styles/                 # CSS styles
```

### API Integration

The plugin communicates with the backend via REST API:

```typescript
// Example API call
const response = await fetch(`${this.settings.serverUrl}/api/tasks/breakdown`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    task: 'Write methodology section',
    context: {
      energyLevel: this.currentEnergyLevel,
      availableTime: 60
    }
  })
});
```

### Event System

The plugin uses Obsidian's event system for real-time updates:

```typescript
// Listen for file changes
this.app.vault.on('modify', (file) => {
  this.trackProgress(file);
});

// Pattern detection events
this.patternDetector.on('pattern-detected', (pattern) => {
  this.handlePattern(pattern);
});
```
